# CamelGamer123-discord-chat-to-portal-2-console

A simple way of taking messages sent in a discord server chat and passing them to portal 2 as console commands.

This is a discord bot created by Kyle Pannan for the sole purpose of passing through discord chat items in a specifc channel through to a portal 2 console. I would like to credit Portal Runner on YouTube for the idea and his enormous assistance when developing this.

To use this bot you must be familiar with the basics of computer networking and know your way around the ipconfig command and ports. Setting up this bot takes around 15 - 20 minutes.
